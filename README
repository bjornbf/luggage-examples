This repo is for example luggage packages. If you're repacking
something commercial, don't add the commercial part - just the
Makefile, plus a script (or preferably a stanza in the Makefile)
to download the commercial part locally before making the package.

If you're going to submit an example, please don't change the
include statement to a non-standard luggage.make location.
